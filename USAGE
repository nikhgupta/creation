Description:
The 'creation new' command creates a new opinionated Rails application by
modifying the default directory structure and configuration generated by
'rails new', at the path you specify.

You can specify extra command-line arguments to be used every time
'creation new' runs in the .railsrc configuration file in your home directory.

Note that the arguments specified in the .railsrc file don't affect the
defaults values shown above in this help message.

Example:
creation new ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
See the README in the newly created application to get going.
